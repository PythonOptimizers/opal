"""

This module contains the fundmental description of a multi-agent systems.
It has three elements: agent, message and environment.

OPAL bases on a very simple multi-agent system in which each agent represents 
for an activity, a functionality. The agents communicate to cooperate by the 
message. The environment provide two basic serives: agent-location service 
and message transport service. 

The interaction of the agent is simple through the environment. There is no 
direct communication between two agents. Instead, the agent send its request, 
signal, reply to environment and choose suitable request from the environment. 

Language of communication is so simple within some type of messages such as 
request data, stop signal, wait signal ...

An multiagent-based application is activated by initializing an environment and
the concerned agents. After that, at least one event is raised to provoke the 
interaction between the agents.

    A basic agent has some administrative methods:
    
    1. Register it to an environment
